# Good Ideas

The best way to get good business ideas is to **stumble on them**:
You work on something and you _notice_ that a certain task is a pain in the ass or very inefficient and you wonder, why do i have to do it this way? Wouldn't it be better to do it this other way...?

What we're really looking for are **PROBLEMS**.

More specifically tasks that are annoying/difficult/expensive both in time and/or money, but most of all **urgent**, things that need to be fixed NOW.
Stumbling on ideas is awesome because you don't have to try to think of business ideas, you just have to _notice_ problems, to notice problems you don't have to necessarily be the person who works on something to deliver, you can notice problems also by being the target user of a certain product.

This approach has another veiled benefit that most people seem to ignore but is the main reason why stumbling on business ideas is the best method among the ones will discuss: when you notice problems you probably aren't the only one having them, so you're more likely going to solve a problem that _exists_.
This way you're exempt from the most common paradox in the startup world: solutions in search of a problem.

If you can't come up with good ideas "organically", you must find out what _problems_ other people are facing, again, this approach is not preferred but sometimes you're forced to come up with good ideas either because you don't have time or because your mind isn't prepared to do so, don't worry, there are mainly 2 other ways to come up with good ideas:

Another way to find good ideas to work on is by "**cold-asking**" a certain category of people (i.e. lawyers, doctors, plumbers, etc...) what's the most (again) annoying/difficult/expensive both in time and/or money thing they have to do in their profession. Once you have a small sample of replies from a certain category (let's say around 40/50) you should have an initial understanding of what are the most common problems they have to deal with daily and based on that you can decide which problem is the most **urgent**.

The last method on your journey to find good business ideas is to **build an audience**, ideally, one based on your interests, through a blog or social media platform. Even if this approach requires time, patience, and commitment, the work needed to grow an audience pays off.
Having an online audience is amazing because you can literally ask them what problems they need to be fixed, build the solution, and most of all they will also be your first customers.

In conclusion, i want to point out that the idea isn't worthless as some people want to remark. The starting idea, even if it changes during the process of finding product-market fit, is the first step towards the realization of your vision.

Good luck!
